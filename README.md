Virtual pet care simulator is a console based application designed to simulates caring for a virtual pet. This comprehensive project encompasses fundamental programming concepts like basic program structure, console I/O, data types, type conversion, and control flow elements.
We can interact with the pet by playing, feeding, and letting it rest and displaying how those interactions effect the status of the pet.
The application also simulates the passage of time and the pet's needs changing over time, also requiring users to interact with it at regular intervals
Overall, the Virtual Pet Care Simulator provides an engaging and interactive experience for users to care for a virtual pet and learn about responsible pet ownership.
